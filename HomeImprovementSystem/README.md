# Bertolf System
## Introduction
This is a hobby project with the primary aim of learning new things. The goal is to create a domotica system that can interact with a home enviroment by creating many different "nodes" that interact with each other. An example of this would be to control a "light source node" using a "wireless remote node". Another option is to control all the nodes with a central mobile application.

Things I want to learn in this project:
Hardware Design, PCB design, Electronics, Microcontrollers, ...


### Possible Nodes
**Input**
- Temperature Sensing Node
- Romote Controller Node
- Solar Panel Node

**Output**
- LCD Screen Node
- Music Node (Audio Amplifier)
- Motor Node (to control blinds or locks for example)

**Other**
- Central Processing Node
- Battery Charging Node
- Signal Repeater Node

## Project Overview
### bfsBasicNode
The first step is to create a basic node called the Basic Node which is described in the bfsBasicNode.md file.

### TODO
- Add pictures to this repository

## Conclusion
