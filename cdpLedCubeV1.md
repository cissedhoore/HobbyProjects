# cdpLedCube


## Project Overview

### Components
- Arduino Pro Micro (Uses a ATMEGA32u4 chip)
- 56 LED's (Yellow)
- a steady soldering hand

### Issues
- The brightness of the leds varies depending on how many are on.
- Soldering all the leds is a big task.

### Improvements
- Creation an individual PCB.
- Adding more leds by using an I/O expander.
- Addition of a powersource and resistors at the anode of the leds to avoid the change in brightness.
- Adding a wireless reciever module.
